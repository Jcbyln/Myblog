                Historical Computing 
The evolution of computing is a fascinating journey that spans creatures.  Transforming how we live, work and communicate  evolution of computing as time passes are developing tools find ways to make it easiest the one situation or problems.computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of Arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming .
Before we used Abacus for basic arithmetic calculation until the time passes our tools are upgraded it becomes to mechanical tools and so on. it help us to build a analytical thinking
Computing has really changed the human because it is a process of teaching to human how they think to the problem solve and how they the world understand thru  Mechanical or Technology tools and also computing helps you to be a quantitative.
I’ll give you the example of highlights key milestones of computing the first one; 
•in 2500 BCE was invention of Abacus one of the easiest computing tools 
•in 1837 Analytical Engine was designed by Charles Babbage it’s consider a first mechanical computer 
•In 1936 Turing Machine proposed by Alan Turing this is theoretical Machine laid the foundation for modern computer Science.
And the impact of computing to society is to support the communication and collaboration between providers and consumers and can manage and help you to organize your data and information in a better way and it has much more computing and calculating power then an ordinary human.

    OVERVIEW OF FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONCEPTS
What is IT?
Information technology, or IT, is the utilization of computers, networking, data storage and connected devices, along with the infrastructure and processes involved, to facilitate business or administrative solutions.



Basic concepts of Information Technology 
•Information security -involves all software and hardware implemented to protect the integrity of the organization’s data. Anti-malware protection, firewalls, encryption, authentication and physical security solutions all fall into this category.
•Computer technical support - includes the upkeep of devices within the enterprise environment, including device troubleshooting, repairs, replacements, individual device security, equipment upgrades and infrastructural maintenance.
•Business software development- IT leaders will still be responsible for implementing the software within devices and infrastructure while ensuring the software meets business needs.
•Database and network management - The ability to access and extract information from databases is also included within this category, as well as digital permission settings that allow only authorized users to access individual pieces of data within a database.
HARDWARE- in Information Technology hardware is a the physical aspects of computers, telecommunications and other devices.
SOFTWARE – Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. 
NETWORKING – computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies
THE ROLE OF IT MODERN –IT plays a critical role in managing and analyzing vast amounts of data, enabling businesses to derive valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.
